# PyCorruptor
A simple script that generates a corrupt file of any kind. You can use this to get extensions on w/projects due soon (Not that I have, or ever will, use this for any purposes that may be construed as academic dishonesty)

All you need to do is specify the name and the type. 

## Stuff needed:
* python (duh)
* the .sh script as well (just a few packages, nothing important)
  * if you dont want a bunch of packages everywhere use a virtualenv

## How to use:
1. Download and navigate to the folder
2. Run the .sh script by double clicking -- Only do this the first time
2. run this command:

```
python3 corruptor.py --size=(any int less than 10 billion)
```
